# Analysis of seasonal game data of the National Basketball Association teams and leveraging data to predict match outcomes

## Overview of the project
Historical game data has become a pivotal component to analyze individual and team performance. 	Analyzing data has become an industry standard to improve working conventions and realize key business objectives. 

Basketball is one of the popular sports in North America and has a lot of data readily accessible for the public to see and use. This project will analyze the National Basketball Association seasonal game data and create a model that predicts which team will win in a given matchup. 

## Data Resources
- games.csv (all games from 2004 season to last update with the date, teams and some details like number of points, etc.)
