- Scrapped primarily from NBA.com[hyperlink to NBA.com], we pulled 10 years of game data, dating from current season 2021-22 to 2012-2013, to use for a Logistic Regression model. Using the data the team was able to create multiple dataframes with different categories appropriate with cleaned data that we decided to use. 
- Using the data we collected we decided to use the parameters of Home and Away: Field Goal, Field Goal PCT, Three point PCT, Defensive and Offensive Rebounds and Assists. 
- We Created a heatmap correlating wins with all available columns and these metrics came back as the most significant. [link to heatmap]

- *Description of how data was split into training and testing*

- Initially we tried to use a nerual network model [link to nn ipynb] to parse the data however we were unsatisified with the results of the accuracy, *NN accuracy numbers* . Through further investigation we discovered that even the best models out there have a working accuracy of about 70% so we are on the right track given it was our first attempt. 
- After talking with the instructors for some guidance we decided to go with two simplier models in an attempt to increase the accuracy, that is how we decided to use a Logistic Regresion model as well as a RandomForest model. 
- Problems we encountered with the Logistic Regression model:

- Problems we encountered with the RandomForest model:
